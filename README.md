# MisFIt - Hackathon 2022 Project  

MisFIt is an innovative application developed during the **Hackathon 2022**. It addresses the increasing concerns about stray dog attacks and provides a comprehensive safety system. The project was built under intense competition within a 24-hour timeframe, showcasing teamwork, innovation, and technical expertise.

## 🌟 Key Features  

1. **Emergency SOS:**  
   - Instantly send alerts to local authorities and nearby users during emergencies.  
   - Real-time notifications ensure prompt action.  

2. **Danger Area Mapping:**  
   - Displays real-time maps indicating areas with high stray dog activity.  
   - Allows users to avoid dangerous zones, ensuring safe routes.  

3. **User Report System:**  
   - Collects and manages reports from users about stray dog sightings and incidents.  
   - Centralized MySQL database to store and analyze the reports.  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  

- **Backend:** Java  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Other Tools:** JSP  

## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Emergency SOS:** Users can press a panic button to send immediate alerts. The alert includes location data, ensuring accurate response.  
2. **Real-Time Mapping:** Integrated mapping system marks high-risk areas based on user reports and past incidents.  
3. **Reporting System:** Users can report sightings or incidents, contributing to a dynamic database that helps keep the community informed.  

## 💡 Inspiration  

Stray dog attacks have become a significant concern in many urban and rural areas. MisFIt aims to address this issue by creating a networked safety system that not only responds to emergencies but also proactively prevents them through awareness and informed navigation.

## 🤝 Collaboration  

MisFIt was built by a dedicated team of developers during Hackathon 2022. The project combined diverse skills, creative problem-solving, and effective collaboration to develop a functional prototype in record time.

## 📈 Impact  

- Improved community safety by reducing stray dog attack incidents.  
- Enhanced awareness of high-risk areas through real-time mapping.  
- Empowered users with a tool for reporting and handling emergencies effectively.  

## 💻 Future Scope  

- Integration with government and animal welfare agencies for better response management.  
- Expansion to cover other safety-related concerns such as hazardous zones or crime-prone areas.  
- Addition of machine learning to predict potential risk zones based on historical data.
